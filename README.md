CIND830 Project
GDP Growth-at-Risk in the Canadian economy
This project replicates the “GDP-at-risk” model, pioneered by Tobias Adrian et al at the International Monetary Fund. The idea is similar to Value-at-Risk (VaR), which calculates the maximum loss expected, typically the fifth quantile of the loss distribution, as opposed to the mean or "expected value." GaR uses quantile regression to estimates the conditional distribution of GDP growth (the response variable) as a function of some forward-looking financial indicator (the explanatory variable). The goal is to find the "at risk" value of GDP growth, defined as the fifth quantile of the conditional growth distribution. 

The project is now in stage 3 of 5 stages:  
•	Stage 1 – Abstract (see folder “Abstract”)
•	Stage 2 – Literature Review (see folder "Literature Review”)
•	Stage 3 – Initial Results and Code (see folder "Initial Results and Code”)

The current stage of the project (Stage 3) includes the following documents
1.	A read.me file
2.	The technical part of project coding in RMD (“Initial Results and Code2.Rmd”) is fully annotated and explains the steps along the way
3.	The results of the coding in an HTML file (“Initial Results and Code2”)
4.	The datasets in excel 

The results will be managed via the following GitHub repository:
